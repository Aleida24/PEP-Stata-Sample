# PEP-Stata-Sample
In this Stata file, I complete a Stata task involving experimental data from the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP) to analyze results 
for an RCT for a microcredit program for Bangladesh. All the necessary data is included with the .do file in this repository. 

So there is no confusion, I have not completed this file as part of work for a prior or current position, since I have signed paperwork
not permitting me to share that code. I conducted this work independently of other work experiences.
